# The logbook project

I'm bored and this is what I decided to make. It uses ratatui and tui-textarea crates.
I don't know if I'll add to this but for now this will just live here till I decide to add features.

## What is this project
I wanted a terminal based logbook where I could jot down notes or treat it like a journal. 

## Features missing
- Consistent control scheme
- A hook up for an ftp server for backups
- General look and feel improvements

## FAQ
What are the quotes from?
- They are from the greatest game ever made **Outer Wilds**

Why rust?
- It was partially a learning experience and got me use to working with crates
